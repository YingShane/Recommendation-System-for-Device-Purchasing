# Recommendation-System-for-Device-Purchasing
This program suggests the most suitable portable device based on user preferences. It analyzes a list of available devices and user-defined feature priorities to propose the best three options. Users can set a minimum of three preferences or just one. If no exact matches are found, at least one possible device is proposed. Users can then select their preferred device and set a budget ceiling for additional accessory options. The program ensures accessory costs stay within the defined budget. Make informed device purchases with this program.
